# Week-12-SQL-Employee-Tracker
MySQL Employee Tracker

This program is designed to allow you to build out a database of employees, complete with departments, managers, roles, and salaries for each employee. Upon launching the program, you are able to view all employees/departments/roles currently in the database, add employees/departments/roles to the database, and update any employee's role. Additional functionality will be added in future updates.

To launch the tracker, simply type in "node server" in the Terminal. Upon doing so, you will be presented with a menu of options: View, Add, Update, and Quit. Select an option and follow the prompts to complete your selected and desired action.

You can access a video demonstration [here](https://youtu.be/jd7utW57fH0) to see the tracker in action.
